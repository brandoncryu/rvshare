# Picking the Perfect RV for Your Trip

Hello prospective campers! 

The goal of this project is to inform and guide fellow campers rent an RV for their camping trip.
I scraped 12,000 rental RV listings from www.rvshare.com using Scrapy on 7/20/20 and performed data analysis on the resulting dataset.

## Content:
* "rvshare" folder contains all code related to scraping the site.
    * Scraping was done in 5 chunks for a more robust process.

* "data" folder contains the csv files from scraping

* RVshare.ipynb file is a jupyter notebook that contains all the python code done for analysis.

* Picking the perfect RV for your trip.pdf contains a presentation on y findings
